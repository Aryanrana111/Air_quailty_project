In this project, I used python to detect a dataset on air quality. My goal was to get important information about pollution levels and seasonal trends.

Important point to remember:

I used ponds and publies to clean and preprprised of raw data.

To improve readability, I converted and standardized classified data like days and months.

I demonstrated the searching data analysis (EDA) to identify the trends of PM2.5 and AQI levels.

I found that in which months the average pollution level was the highest in many years.

I used matplotlib to create visualization that clearly shows my conclusions.

Tech stacks include Python, Pandas, Nompi, Matplotlib and Jupiter notebooks.

This project based on a real -world environmental dataset helped me intensify my data cleaning, EDA and visualization skills.
